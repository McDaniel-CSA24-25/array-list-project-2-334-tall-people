My Role in this project was the list organizer/contact manager project.

Basically i have to create an arraylist of "contacts" that have names and phone numbers. I must then create methods, classes, and constructors to let the user either add a contact, look for a contact, or display their contacts.

The outline of my program will look something like this

imports


arraylist: contacts

addcont method(String name, String number)
	this will also check to see if a contact already exists

method to search for contact using name(String name)

	will loop through contacts and print if found

method to sort contacts
	will use Collections.sort() from the collects package



public static void main

scanner input
listOrganizer constructor
int to know user input

while true(print out a menu that asks to add, search, or show contacts)

a try catch to notify user if they put an invalid number in

user choice 1 will use add cont and my constructor to add a contact

user choice 2 will allow a user to search a contact by using constructor and lookup method, will tell user the index position of the contact if found

user choice 3 will use the sortcont method to alphabetically sort the contacts
